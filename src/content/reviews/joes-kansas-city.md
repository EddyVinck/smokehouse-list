Joe's Kansas City's burnt ends are a religious experience. The combination of bark, smoke, and tender beef is unmatched. Getting BBQ from a gas station never felt so right!

## What I Ordered
- Burnt Ends Sandwich
- Fries
- Coleslaw

The burnt ends were perfectly cubed, each piece a perfect mix of bark and tender meat. The sauce complement's the meat's smokiness perfectly without overwhelming it.
