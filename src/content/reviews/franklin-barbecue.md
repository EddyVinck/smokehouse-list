The wait was long, but absolutely worth it. Aaron Franklin's brisket is a masterpiece of smoke and patience. The bark was perfect, and the meat literally melted in my mouth. The fatty point end was especially memorable.

## Highlights
- Perfect smoke ring
- Incredibly tender
- Amazing pepper-forward bark
- Friendly staff despite the crowds

Even after a 3-hour wait, I'd do it again in a heartbeat. This is BBQ perfection.
